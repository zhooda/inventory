# Daily Item Inventory Manager - OOP1 Multi Day

This program is designed to display personal items in multiple storage locations, move items between locations, and add or remove items.

## Getting Started

These instructions *should* get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine. This is usually just for development and testing,
but we have no deployment strategies, so have at it.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6.x + (cuz f-strings, duh!)
- Common Sense (any version)
- Supported OS (ie. Linux, Windows, or macOS)

#### Installation & Usage

Yikes so it turns out the following instructions might not actually work anymore because the repo is forced private? Oh well I guess only MR. ZHANG needs to see this anyways.

```
# Clone the repository (stable branch)
git clone -b master https://git.mikezhang.ca/z.hooda/inventory.git
# OR download zip file from BIG GREEN BUTTON

# Go to the project directory
cd ~/inventory

# Run python main
python main.py
'''
